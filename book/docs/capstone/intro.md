# Capstone Guide + Rubrics

## Overview

This section provides comprehensive guidance for your final capstone project, a culminating experience where you will apply the knowledge and skills gained throughout this textbook to a real-world problem in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Project Goals

-   **Integrate Knowledge**: Combine concepts from kinematics, dynamics, ROS 2, simulation (Gazebo/Isaac Sim), and conversational AI.
-   **Problem Solving**: Address a practical challenge in the field.
-   **System Design**: Develop a well-structured and functional robotic system (simulated or physical).
-   **Documentation & Presentation**: Clearly articulate your project, findings, and contributions.

## Project Requirements

Each capstone project must demonstrate the following:

-   **[CR1] Problem Definition**: A clear statement of the problem being addressed and its significance.
-   **[CR2] System Design**: A detailed architectural design of your robotic system, including hardware (simulated) and software components.
-   **[CR3] Implementation**: Functional code demonstrating the core functionalities of your project.
-   **[CR4] Simulation/Demonstration**: A compelling demonstration of your project in a simulated environment (Gazebo, Isaac Sim, or Unity) or on a physical robot.
-   **[CR5] Evaluation**: Quantitative or qualitative evaluation of your system's performance against defined metrics.
-   **[CR6] Report**: A written report detailing your project from concept to conclusion.
-   **[CR7] Presentation**: A final presentation summarizing your project to peers and instructors.
-   **[CR8] Code Repository**: A well-organized and documented GitHub repository.

### Example Project Ideas

-   **Autonomous Navigation**: A robot navigating a complex environment using ROS 2, SLAM, and path planning.
-   **Human-Robot Interaction**: A robot that responds to voice commands and performs simple tasks based on visual cues.
-   **Object Manipulation**: A robotic arm using computer vision to pick and place objects in a cluttered scene.
-   **Humanoid Gait Generation**: Implement and optimize a walking gait for a humanoid robot in simulation.

## Rubrics

Your capstone project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

| Criteria              | Weight (%) | Description                                                                                                                              |
| :-------------------- | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Problem Definition**  | 10         | Clarity, relevance, and originality of the problem statement.                                                                           |
| **System Design**       | 20         | Completeness, modularity, and justification of architectural choices.                                                                    |
| **Implementation**      | 30         | Code quality, functionality, adherence to design, and effective use of covered topics (ROS 2, simulation, AI).                             |
| **Demonstration**       | 20         | Effectiveness and clarity of the simulated/physical demonstration. Robustness and real-time performance.                                  |
| **Evaluation & Analysis** | 10         | Rigor of performance evaluation, insightfulness of analysis, and identification of limitations/future work.                               |
| **Report & Presentation** | 10         | Clarity, organization, technical accuracy of the report, and engagement/delivery of the presentation.                                     |

## Submission Guidelines

1.  **Project Proposal (Week 8)**:
    -   A brief document (1-2 pages) outlining your problem, proposed solution, and tools.
    -   Submitted via [LMS Link/Email].

2.  **Mid-Term Progress Report (Week 11)**:
    -   A progress update, initial design, and any challenges encountered.
    -   Submitted via [LMS Link/Email].

3.  **Final Report (End of Week 13)**:
    -   A comprehensive report (5-10 pages, excluding appendices) covering all aspects of your project.
    -   Submitted via [LMS Link/Email].

4.  **Final Presentation & Demonstration (End of Week 13)**:
    -   A 15-minute presentation followed by a 5-minute Q&A.
    -   Live demonstration of your robot system (simulated or physical).
    -   Scheduled during the last week of class.

5.  **GitHub Repository**: Ensure your repository is publicly accessible (or shared with instructors) and contains all project code, documentation, and a clear `README.md`.

## Academic Integrity

All work submitted must be your own. Collaboration is encouraged, but individual contributions must be clearly identifiable. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
