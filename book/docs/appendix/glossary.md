## A

**Actuator**: A device that converts energy into physical motion (e.g., motors, servos).

**Autonomous**: Operating independently without human intervention.

## C

**Computer Vision**: Field of AI that enables computers to interpret visual information.

## D

**Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical system used for simulation and testing.

## E

**Embedding**: A numerical representation of data (text, images) in a vector space.

## H

**Humanoid Robot**: A robot designed to resemble and function like a human.

## I

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: A sensor that measures acceleration and angular velocity.

**Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's robotics simulation platform.

## L

**LiDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging - a sensor that measures distance using laser light.

## P

**Perception**: The process of interpreting sensor data to understand the environment.

**Physical AI**: AI systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: Open-source middleware for robotics development.

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: AI technique that combines retrieval of information with text generation.

## S

**Sensor**: A device that detects and measures physical properties (e.g., cameras, temperature sensors).

**Sim-to-Real**: Transferring skills learned in simulation to real-world robots.
